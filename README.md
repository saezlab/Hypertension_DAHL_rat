# DAHL rat analysis

The following repository contains the scripts used for the analysis of the
phosphorylation data from DAHL rats using
[PHONEMeS-ILP](https://github.com/saezlab/PHONEMeS-ILP).

It is assumed that the contents of the [`PHONEMeS-ILP/Public` folder](https://github.com/saezlab/PHONEMeS-ILP/tree/master/Public) are inside a subfolder on the working directory.

## Dependencies

All the scripts are written in R, the packages needed in order to run the
complete analysis are:

- readr
- dplyr
- limma
- XML
- UniProt.ws
- igraph
- BioNet
